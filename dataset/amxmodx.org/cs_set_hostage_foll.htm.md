As always hostages must be following a CT entity to be rescued. i.e. Try, as a Terrorist (in an old CS version or using the Terrorist/Hostage plugin), to get the hostage to come with you to the rescue point (it will not get rescued). Likewise, a hostage standing in a rescue point will only be rescued AFTER it is activated by a CT (cs_moria).
