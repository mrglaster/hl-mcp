Description

Syntax
cs_set_no_knives ( [ noknives = 0 ] ) 
Type
Native 
Notes
Enable no knives mode by calling this with a value of 1. Disable it with a value of 0. No knives mode means that player will not be given a knife when spawning. You can still give knives (ie: through the Fun Module's [give_item](http://127.0.0.1:8000/fun/give_item.htm)).
