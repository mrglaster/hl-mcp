# floatatan2
#### Syntax
```
native Float:floatatan2(Float:x, Float:y, {anglemode,_}:radix);
```

#### Usage
x | ```Value representing the proportion of the x-coordinate.```
---|---
y | ```Value representing the proportion of the x-coordinate.```
mode | ```What unit of measurement should the output angle be in```
#### Description
```
Computes the principal value of arctangent of y/x
```

#### Note
```
Someone should verify this native, not sure what it actually does.
```

#### Note
```
For available units of measurements(modes) look at the anglemode enum
```

#### Return
```
Arctangent of y/x
```
